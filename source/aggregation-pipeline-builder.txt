*New in version 1.14.0.*

The Aggregation Pipeline Builder in |compass| lets you create
:manual:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to process
documents from a collection or view and return computed results. For
example, you can use aggregation pipelines to:

- Group values from multiple documents together.

- Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.

- Analyze data changes over time.

To build an aggregation pipeline, choose a collection and click the
:guilabel:`Aggregations` tab. |compass-short| displays a blank
aggregation pipeline. The :guilabel:`Preview of Documents in the
Collection` section shows 20 documents randomly sampled from the chosen
collection.

.. note:: Atlas Search Stages

   When you connect |compass-short| to a MongoDB deployment hosted on 
   `Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_compass>`_,
   additional Atlas-only stages 
   :atlas:`$search </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-search>` and
   :atlas:`$searchMeta </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-searchmeta>`
   are available in the Aggregation Pipeline Builder. Use these stages 
   to perform 
   :atlas:`full-text search</atlas-search/atlas-search-overview>` 
   on Atlas collections.

.. _create-agg-pipeline:

Create an Aggregation Pipeline
------------------------------

|compass| provides different modes to create aggregation pipelines:

- Stage View Mode, a visual pipeline editor that preloads pipeline syntax based 
  on your selected stages.

- Stage Wizard, a feature of Stage View Mode that provides a set of templates 
  for simple aggregation stage use cases. The Stage Wizard acts as a
  starting point to gradually build complexity into your pipeline.

- Focus Mode, a feature of Stage View Mode where you edit one pipeline stage at 
  a time. Focus Mode helps you manage complex or deeply nested aggregation 
  pipeline stages.

- Text View Mode, a text-based pipeline editor that accepts raw
  pipeline syntax. 

To see how to create an aggregation pipeline, select the tab corresponding to 
your chosen view mode:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Stage View Mode 
      :tabid: stage 

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Stage` view.
            
            In the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the 
            :guilabel:`{} Stages` toggle switch is selected.

            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-stageview-toggle-on.png
               :alt: Toggle on stage view mode 

         .. step:: Add an aggregation stage. 
            
            At the bottom of the aggregation pipeline pane, click the 
            :guilabel:`+ Add Stage` button.
            
         .. step:: Select an aggregation pipeline stage.
            
            On the upper-left corner of the aggregation stage card, 
            click the :guilabel:`Select` drop-down menu and select the 
            :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage 
            </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` to use for the first 
            stage of the pipeline. 

         .. step:: Fill in your pipeline stage. 
            
            Fill in your selected stage. You can adjust the width of the 
            pipeline stage by dragging its border to the right.

            .. note::
               
               .. include:: /includes/fact-agg-pipeline-preview-toggle.rst 
               
               For example, the following pipeline excludes the first 
               :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage 
               and only includes the 
               :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`
               stage:

                  :alt: Aggregation Builder exclude stage example
         
         .. step:: Add additional pipeline stages.
            
            To add an additional pipeline stage after your last aggregation 
            stage, click :guilabel:`Add Stage`. To add an aggregation stage 
            before your most recently added stage, click the :guilabel:`+` icon 
            above the stage card. 
            
            Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each additional stage.

            .. note:: 

               You can change the order of pipeline stages by dragging 
               the header of each stage card.

         .. step:: Run the pipeline. 
            
            At the top-right corner of the pipeline builder, click 
            :guilabel:`Run`. 
            
            |compass-short| returns your results in the document view. 

   .. tab:: Stage Wizard 
      :tabid: wizard 

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal
         
         .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Stages` view.
            
            In the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the 
            :guilabel:`{} Stages` toggle switch is selected.

            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-stageview-toggle-on.png
               :figwidth: 300 px
               :alt: Toggle on stage view mode 

         .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Stage Wizard` card. 
            
            To the right of the view mode toggle, click the :guilabel:`Wizard` 
            icon to open the :guilabel:`Stage Wizard` card.

            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-stage-wizard.png
               :figwidth: 300 px
               :alt: Click the icon to the right of the view mode toggle.

         .. step:: Select an aggregation pipeline stage use case.

            On the :guilabel:`Stage Wizard` card, select the stage use case for 
            the first stage of the pipeline. |compass-short| populates the the 
            stage card with a form that corresponds with the selected 
            aggregation pipeline stage.

            The Stage Wizard use cases include the following aggregation stages:

            - :pipeline:`$group`

            - :pipeline:`$lookup`

            - :pipeline:`$match`
            
            - :pipeline:`$project`
            
            - :pipeline:`$sort`

         .. step:: Fill in your pipeline stage. 

            Fill in the form for your selected stage and click 
            :guilabel:`Apply`. After you click :guilabel:`Apply`, the form will 
            turn into a stage card that you can edit in Stage View Mode, Focus 
            Mode, or Text View Mode. 

            |compass-short| populates the Stage Output with up to ten sample 
            output documents.

            .. note:: 

               You cannot edit an existing stage through the Stage Wizard. The 
               Stage Wizard can only add new stages. To edit an existing stage, 
               use Stage View Mode, Focus Mode, or Text View Mode.

         .. step:: Add additional pipeline stages. 

            To add more aggregation stages to your pipeline, repeat steps 3 
            and 4 for each additional stage. 
            
            By default, the Stage Wizard adds each new stage to the end of 
            your pipeline. You can change the order of pipeline stages by 
            dragging the header of each stage card. 

         .. step:: Run the pipeline. 

            At the top-right corner of the pipeline builder, click 
            :guilabel:`Run`. |compass-short| returns your results in the 
            document view.
