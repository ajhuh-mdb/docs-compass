Starting in |compass| version 1.39.2, |compass-short| no longer supports  
migration from legacy connection files that pre-date version 1.31.0. 
Legacy connections refer to an internal |compass-short| connection-options 
format that is stored on disk and no longer supported beyond |compass| 
version 1.39.0. 
    
If you have legacy connections saved in your favorites, export the 
connections on version 1.39.0 and convert them into the new format before 
updating to version 1.39.2.
