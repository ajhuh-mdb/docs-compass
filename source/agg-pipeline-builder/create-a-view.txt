Create a View from Pipeline Results

To quickly access the results of an aggregation pipeline without having to 
execute an aggregation pipeline, you can create a :ref:`view <compass-views>` 
on |compass|. Views are read-only, so they can help keep your data secure by 
limiting user access to a predefined set of results. 

About This Task 
---------------

Creating a view does not save the aggregation pipeline itself. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the Save dropdown button

      In the aggregation pipeline pane, click the :guilabel:`Save` drop-down 
      menu and select :guilabel:`Create view`.

   .. step:: Enter a name for your view

   .. step:: Confirm your view creation 

      Click the :guilabel:`Create` button to create your view. |compass-short| 
      creates a view from your pipeline results in the same database where the 
      pipeline was created and displays saved views with the eye icon.
