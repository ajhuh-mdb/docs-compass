To use your aggregated data in other external tools, you can export your 
pipeline results from |compass| as a JSON or CSV file. 

About This Task

Avoid exporting to CSV files when possible. CSV files may lose type information 
and are not suitable for backing up your data.

      If choose to export your data as a :guilabel:`JSON` file, you can expand 
      the :guilabel:`Advanced JSON Format` drop-down menu and select from the 
      following extended JSON formats: 

      .. include:: /includes/extended-json-table.rst

   .. step:: Click Export

   .. step:: Specify export destination

      In the new pop-up modal, enter a name for your export file, specify the file
