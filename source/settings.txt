To customize user access and privacy in |compass|, you can configure your 
|compass-short| settings in the :guilabel:`Settings` dialog box, 
the :ref:`command line <cli-options>`, or a :ref:`configuration file 
<config-file>`.

Use Cases 
---------

You can specify |compass-short| settings and behaviors to customize your 
|compass-short| experience. For administrators, you can modify the 
|compass-short| settings to restrict what actions users can take.

For example:

- If you need to limit users from viewing sensitive information when 
  connecting to MongoDB, you can run Compass with credentials hidden
  from their connection string.

- If you want to automate the launch of |compass-short| without any input 
  required from users, you can use the command line to launch |compass-short| 
  with specified configuration options. 

- If you have multiple team members using |compass-short|, you can use a common 
  configuration file to ensure a consistent user experience.
