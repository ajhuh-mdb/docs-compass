To customize user access and privacy in |compass|, you can configure your 
|compass-short| settings in the :guilabel:`Settings` dialog box, 
the :ref:`command line <cli-options>`, or a :ref:`configuration file 
<config-file>`.

Use Cases 
---------

Administrators can specify |compass-short| settings and behaviors. For example:

- If you need to restrict what actions users can perform in |compass-short|, you 
  can disable the embedded shell and make |compass-short| read-only.

- If you need to prevent users from seeing credentials in their |compass-short| 
  connection string, you can run Compass with the credentials redacted from 
  their connection string.

- If you have multiple team members using |compass-short|, you can use a common 
  configuration file to ensure a consistent user experience.
