To quickly connect to a shared deployment, you can export and share your
favorite connections. Colleagues can import your favorites, or you can
use them yourself in your other workspaces.

.. important:: Export Contains Sensitive Information

   By default, when you export favorite connections, database usernames
   and passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive
   connection information, you may encrypt the exported file with
   a passphrase. When you do, users must specify the matching passphrase to 
   import the connections.
