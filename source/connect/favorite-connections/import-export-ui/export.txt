You can export favorite connections on |compass|. Colleagues can import your 
favorite connections, or you can use them in your other workspaces.

About This Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you export favorite connections, |compass-short| exports the list
of connections as a JSON file.

By default, when you export favorite connections, database usernames and
passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive connection
information, you can omit secrets from the file or encrypt the exported file 
with a passphrase.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To export encrypted favorite connections with |compass-short|:

.. procedure::
    :style: normal
    
    .. step:: Hover over :guilabel:`Saved Connections` in the left-side 
        navigation and click the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` button.

    .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Export saved connections` to open the export 
        dialog box. 

    .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Export saved connections` dialog box, select the 
        connection names you want to export. 

    .. step:: Under :guilabel:`Target File`, click :guilabel:`Select a file...` 
        to specify the output file destination.

    .. step:: *Optional*. Toggle :guilabel:`Remove secrets` to omit passwords, 
        access tokens, and other sensitive information from the exported file.

        If you select :guilabel:`Remove secrets`, you cannot specify an 
        encryption password.
    
    .. step:: *Optional*. Specify an :guilabel:`Encryption Password` to encrypt 
        passwords, access tokens, and other sensitive information.
        
        If you do not encrypt the export file, database usernames and passwords 
        are exported in plaintext. Only export unencrypted connections if no 
        other users will have access to the exported file.

    .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Export` to export your favorite connections to 
        a JSON file.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following sample export file includes two favorite connections and encrypts 
sensitive connection information in the ``connectionSecrets`` field:
