You can import favorite connections in |compass|. This lets you use saved 
connections from other workspaces or connections used by other team members.

Prerequisite
------------

Before you import favorite connections, you must :ref:`export the
connections <compass-export-connections-ui>`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To import favorite connections from a JSON file into |compass-short|:

.. procedure::
    :style: normal
    
    .. step:: On the Connect screen, hover over :guilabel:`Saved Connections` 
        in the left-side navigation and click the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` 
        button.

    .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Import saved connections`.

    .. step:: Under :guilabel:`Source File`, click :guilabel:`Select a file`. 
        
    .. step:: Select the exported JSON file you want to import.

    .. step:: If your file is encrypted with a password, enter the passphrase 
        under :guilabel:`Decryption Password`.
    
    .. step:: Select the connection names you want to 
        import. 
        
        If the connection is already saved, |compass-short| overwrites the 
        existing connection with the imported connection.

    .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Import`.
        
Results
~~~~~~~

After the connections are imported, you will see them on the left-side 
navigation of the Connect screen under :guilabel:`Saved Connections`.
