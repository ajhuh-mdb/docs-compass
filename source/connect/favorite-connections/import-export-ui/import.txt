You can import favorite connections on |compass|. This lets you use saved 
connections from other workspaces or connections used by other team members.

Prerequisite
------------

To import favorite connections, you must first :ref:`export the
connections <compass-export-connections-ui>`.

Procedure
---------

To import favorite connections from a JSON file into |compass-short|:

.. procedure::
    :style: normal
    
    .. step:: Hover over :guilabel:`Saved Connections` in the left-side navigation and click the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` button.

    .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Import saved connections`. 

        Once you select :guilabel:`Import saved connections`, a dialog box 
        appears on |compass-short|.

    .. step:: Under :guilabel:`Source File`, click :guilabel:`Select a file...` to select the exported JSON file you want to import.

    .. step:: If your file is encrypted with a password, enter the passphrase under :guilabel:`Decryption Password`.
    
    .. step:: Select the connection names you want to import.

        If the connection is already saved, |compass-short| overwrites the 
        existing connection with the imported connection.

    .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Import`. 

Once the connections are imported, you will see them under
:guilabel:`Saved Connections` on the left-side navigation of the Connect screen.
