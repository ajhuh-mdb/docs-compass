To quickly connect to a shared deployment, export and share your
favorite connections. Colleagues can import your favorites, or you can
use them yourself in your other workspaces.

.. important:: Export Contains Sensitive Information

   By default, when you export favorite connections, database usernames
   and passwords are included in plaintext. To protect sensitive
   connection information, encrypt the exported file with a passphrase. When 
   you do, users must specify the matching passphrase to import the connections.
