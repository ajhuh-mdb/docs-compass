Starting in version 1.39.2, |compass| no longer supports migrating from legacy 
connection files that pre-date version 1.31.0. Legacy connections refer to an 
internal |compass-short| connection-options format that is stored on disk and no 
longer supported after version 1.39.0. 
    
If you have legacy connections saved in your favorites, export the 
connections on version 1.39.0 to convert them into the new format before 
updating to version 1.39.2.
