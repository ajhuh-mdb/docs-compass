:manual:`Time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/>` efficiently 
store sequences of measurements over a period of time. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Create Collection` button.

      From the :guilabel:`Collections` screen, click the 
      :guilabel:`Create Collection` button.

   .. step:: Enter the collection name.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Advanced Collection Options` dropdown.

      Check the :guilabel:`Time Series Collection` option.

   .. step:: Specify a :guilabel:`timeField`.

      Specify which field should be used as the ``timeField`` for the time-series 
      collection. This field must have a :manual:`BSON type date </reference/bson-types/>`.

      The following fields are optional:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50 

         * - Field
           - Description 

         * - ``metaField``
           - The name of the field which contains metadata in each time series 
             document. The metadata in the specified field should be data that 
             is used to label a unique series of documents. 

         * - ``granularity``
           - The ``granularity`` field allows you to specify a coarser 
             granularity so measurements over a longer time span can be more 
             efficiently stored and queried.

             The default value is set to ``seconds``.

             If you set the ``granularity`` parameter, you can't set the 
             ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` parameters.

         * - ``expireAfterSeconds``
           -  The ``expireAfterSeconds`` field enables automatic deletion of 
              documents older than the specified number of seconds.  
         
         * - ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``
           -  The ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` field specifies the maximum time span 
              between measurements in a :manual:`bucket 
              </core/timeseries/timeseries-granularity/#flexible-bucketing>`. 

              The value of ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` must be the same as 
              ``bucketRoundingSeconds``. If you set the ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``, 
              parameter, you can't set the ``granularity`` parameter.

         * - ``bucketRoundingSeconds``
           -  The ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` field specifies the time interval 
              that determines the starting timestamp for a new :manual:`bucket 
              </core/timeseries/timeseries-granularity/#flexible-bucketing>`. 

              The value of ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` must be the same as 
              ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``. If you set the ``bucketRoundingSeconds``, 
              parameter, you can't set the ``granularity`` parameter.

      For more information on time series fields, see 
      :manual:`</core/timeseries/timeseries-procedures/#timeseries-object-fields>`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Collection` to create the collection.

      Your collection will be marked by a :guilabel:`time series` badge. On the 
      left-hand navigation bar your time series collection will have the 
      following icon:

         :figwidth: 450 px
         :alt: Time Series Icon

Restrictions and Limitations
----------------------------

The following restrictions and limitations apply when creating a time series 
collection:

- :guilabel:`Custom collation` is the only :guilabel:`Advanced Collection Option` 
  that can be used alongside your time series collation.  

- See :manual:`Time Series Collection Limitations </core/timeseries/timeseries-limitations/>` 
  for all time series collection limitations.
